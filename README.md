## Introduction

Quantum computing is an emerging field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that classical computers struggle with. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of various quantum algorithms using the Cirq library.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) library (install via `pip install cirq`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd quantum-algorithms
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Implemented Algorithms

The following quantum algorithms are currently implemented:

- [X] Quantum Random Number Generator
- [ ] Grover's Search Algorithm
- [ ] Shor's Algorithm
- [ ] ... (more to be added!)
